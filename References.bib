abstract = {We consider a competitive system with nonlocal dispersals in a 1-dimensional environment that is worsening with a constant speed, reflected by two shifting growth functions. By analyzing the spatial-temporal dynamics of the model system, we are able to identify certain ranges for the worsening speed c, respectively for (i) extinction of both species; (ii) extinction of one species but persistence of the other; (iii) persistence of both species. In the case of persistence of a species, it is achieved through spreading to the direction of favorable environment with certain speed(s), and some estimates of these speeds are also obtained. We also present some numeric simulation results which confirm our theoretical results, and in the mean time, motivate some challenging problems for future work.}

title = {Path integrals and symmetry breaking for optimal control theory},
journal = {Journal of Statistical Mechanics: Theory and Experiment},
abstract = {This paper considers linear-quadratic control of a non-linear dynamical system subject to arbitrary cost. I show that for this class of stochastic control problems the non-linear Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation can be transformed into a linear equation. The transformation is similar to the transformation used to relate the classical Hamilton–Jacobi equation to the Schrödinger equation. As a result of the linearity, the usual backward computation can be replaced by a forward diffusion process that can be computed by stochastic integration or by the evaluation of a path integral. It is shown how in the deterministic limit the Pontryagin minimum principle formalism is recovered. The significance of the path integral approach is that it forms the basis for a number of efficient computational methods, such as Monte Carlo sampling, the Laplace approximation and the variational approximation. We show the effectiveness of the first two methods in a number of examples. Examples are given that show the qualitative difference between stochastic and deterministic control and the occurrence of symmetry breaking as a function of the noise.}

abstract = {Invasive species, which can be responsible for severe economic and environmental damages, must often be managed over a wide area with limited resources, and the optimal allocation of effort in space and time can be challenging. If the spatial range of the invasive species is large, control actions might be applied only on some parcels of land, for example because of property type, accessibility, or limited human resources. Selecting the locations for control is critical and can significantly impact management efficiency. To help make decisions concerning the spatial allocation of control actions, we propose a simulation based approach, where the spatial distribution of the invader is approximated by a reaction–diffusion model. We extend the classic Fisher equation to incorporate the effect of control both in the diffusion and local growth of the invader. The modified reaction–diffusion model that we propose accounts for the effect of control, not only on the controlled locations, but on neighboring locations, which are based on the theoretical speed of the invasion front. Based on simulated examples, we show the superiority of our model compared to the state-of-the-art approach. We illustrate the use of this model for the management of Burmese pythons in the Everglades (Florida, USA). Thanks to the generality of the modified reaction–diffusion model, this framework is potentially suitable for a wide class of management problems and provides a tool for managers to predict the effects of different management strategies.}
